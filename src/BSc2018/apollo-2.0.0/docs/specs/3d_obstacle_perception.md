3D Obstacle Perception
===================

There are three main components of 3D obstacle perception:

-   LiDAR Obstacle Perception
-   RADAR Obstacle Perception
-   Obstacle Results Fusion

## LiDAR Obstacle Perception

The details of LiDAR obstacle perception pipeline are provided in the following sections, including: 

- HDMap Region of Interest (ROI) Filter
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Segmentation
- MinBox Builder
- HM Object Tracker
- Sequential Type Fusion

### HDMap Region of Interest (ROI) Filter

The Region of Interest (ROI) specifies the drivable area that includes
road surfaces and junctions are retrieved from the HD
(hi-resolution) map. The HDMap ROI filter processes LiDAR points that
are outside ROI, removing background objects, e.g., buildings and trees
around the road. What remains are the point cloud in the ROI for
subsequent processing.

Given a HD map, the affiliation of each LiDAR point indicates whether it
is inside or outside the ROI. Each LiDAR point can be queried with a
lookup table (LUT) of 2D quantization of the region around the car. The
input and output of the HDMap ROI filter module are summarized in the
table below.

| Input                                    | Output                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| The point cloud: A set of 3D points captured from LiDAR Sensor. | The indices of input points that are inside the ROI defined by HDMap. |
| HDMap: A set of polygons each of which is an ordered set of points. |                                          |


In general, the Apollo HDMap ROI filter consists of three successive
steps:

1.  Coordinate transformation

2.  ROI LUT construction

3.  Point inquiry with ROI LUT

#### Coordinate Transformation

For the HDMap ROI filter, the data interface for HD map is defined in
terms of a set of polygons, each of which is actually an ordered set of
points in the world coordinate system. Running an inquiry on the points
with the HDMap ROI requires that the point cloud and polygons are
represented in the same coordinate system. For this purpose, Apollo
transforms the points of input point cloud and the HDMap polygons into a
local coordinate system that originates from the LiDAR sensor’s
location.

#### ROI LUT Construction

To determine an input point whether inside or outside the ROI, Apollo
adopts a grid-wise LUT that quantifies the ROI into a birds-eye view 2D
grid. As shown in figure 1, this LUT covers a rectangle region, bounded
by a predefined spatial range around the general view from above in the
boundary of HDMap. Then it represents the affiliation with the ROI for
each cell of the grid (i.e., 1/0 represents it is inside/outside the
ROI). For computational efficiency, Apollo uses a scan line algorithm
and bitmap encoding to construct the ROI LUT.

<div align=center><img src="images/3d_obstacle_perception/roi_lookup_table.png"></div>
<div align=center>Figure 1 Illustration of ROI lookup table (LUT)</div>

The blue lines show the boundary of HDMap ROI, including road surfaces and 
junctions. The red solid dot represents the origin of the local coordinate 
system corresponding to the LiDAR sensor’s location. The 2D grid is composed 
of 8×8 cells that are shown as green squares. The cells inside the ROI are 
blue-filled squares while the ones outside the ROI are yellow-filled squares.

#### Point Inquiry with ROI LUT

Based on the ROI LUT, the affiliation of each input point is queried
using two-step verification. Then, Apollo conducts data compilation and
output as described below. For the point inquiry process, Apollo:

1.  Checks whether the point is inside or outside the rectangle region
    of ROI LUT.

2.  Queries the corresponding cell of the point in the LUT for its
    affiliation with respect to the ROI.

3.  Collects all the points that belong to the ROI and output their
    indices with respect to the input point cloud.

The user-defined parameters can be set in the configuration file of
modules/perception/model/hdmap_roi_filter.config. Please refer the
table below on the usage of parameters for HDMap ROI Filter.

| Parameter Name | Usage                                    | Default     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| range          | The range of ROI LUT (the 2D grid) with respect to the origin (LiDAR sensor). | 70.0 meters |
| cell_size      | The size of cells for quantizing the 2D grid. | 0.25 meter  |
| extend_dist    | The distance of extending the ROI from the polygon boundary. | 0.0 meter   |

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Segmentation

After the HDMap ROI filter, Apollo obtains the filtered point cloud that
includes *only* the points inside ROI (i.e., the drivable road and
junction areas). Most of the background obstacles, such as buildings and
trees around the road region, have been removed, and the point cloud
inside ROI is fed into the segmentation module. This process detects and
segments out foreground obstacles, e.g., cars, trucks, bicycles, and
pedestrians.

| Input                                    | Output                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| The point cloud (a set of 3D points)     | A set of objects corresponding to obstacles in the ROI. |
| The point indices indicating points inside the ROI as defined in HDMap |                                          |


Apollo uses a deep CNN for accurate obstacle detection and segmentation.
The Apollo CNN segmentation consists of four successive steps:

-   Channel Feature Extraction

-   CNN-Based Obstacle Predication

-   Obstacle Clustering

-   Post-processing

The following sections describe the deep CNN in detail.

#### Channel Feature Extraction

Given a frame of point cloud, Apollo build a birds-eye view (i.e.,
projected to the X-Y plane) 2D grid in the local coordinate system. Each
point within a predefined range with respect to the origin (i.e., the
LiDAR sensor) is quantized into one cell of the 2D grid based on its X
and Y coordinates. After quantization, Apollo computes 8 statistical
measurements of the points for each cell of the grid, which will be the
input channel features fed into the CNN in the next step. The
statistical measurements computed are the:

1.  Maximum height of points in the cell

2.  Intensity of the highest point in the cell

3.  Mean height of points in the cell

4.  Mean intensity of points in the cell

5.  Number of points in the cell

6.  Angle of the cell’s center with respect to the origin

7.  Distance between the cell’s center and the origin

8.  Binary value indicating whether the cell is empty or occupied

#### CNN-Based Obstacle Predication

Based on the channel features described above, Apollo uses a deep fully
convolutional neural network (FCNN) to predict the cell-wise obstacle
attributes including the offset displacement with respect to the
potential object center, called center offset, (see figure 2 below),
objectness, positiveness, and object height. As shown in figure 2, the
input of the network is a *W*×*H*×*C* channel image where:

-   *W* represents the column number of the grid.

-   *H* represents the row number of the grid.

-   *C* represents the number of channel features.

The FCNN is composed of three layers:

-   Downstream encoding layers (feature encoder)

-   Upstream decoding layers (feature decoder)

-   Obstacle attribute prediction layers (predictor)

The feature encoder takes the channel feature image as input and
successively down-samples its spatial resolution with increasing feature
abstraction. Then the feature decoder gradually up-samples the encoded
feature image to the spatial resolution of the input 2D grid, which can
recover the spatial details of feature image to facilitate the cell-wise
obstacle attribute prediction. The down-sampling and up-sampling
operations are implemented in terms of stacked convolution/devolution
layers with non-linear activation (i.e., ReLu) layers.

<div align=center><img src="images/3d_obstacle_perception/FCNN-with-class.png"></div>

<div align=center>Figure 2 The FCNN for cell-wise obstacle prediction</div>

#### Obstacle Clustering

After the CNN-based prediction step, Apollo obtains prediction
information for individual cells. Apollo utilizes five cell object
attribute images that contain the:

-   Center offset
-   Objectness
-   Positiveness
-   Object height
-   Class probability

To generate obstacle objects, Apollo constructs a directed graph based on the cell center offset prediction and searches the connected components as candidate object clusters.

As shown in figure 3, each cell is a node of the graph and the directed
edge is built based on the center offset prediction of the cell, which
points to its parent node corresponding to another cell.

Given this graph, Apollo adopts a compressed Union Find algorithm to
efficiently find the connected components, each of which is a candidate
obstacle object cluster. The objectness is the probability of being a
valid object for one individual cell. So Apollo defines the non-object
cells as the ones with the objectness less than 0.5. Thus Apollo filters
out the empty cells and non-object ones for each candidate object
cluster.

<div align=center><img src="images/3d_obstacle_perception/obstacle_clustering.png"></div>

<div align=center>Figure 3 Illustration of obstacle clustering</div>

(a) The red arrow represents the object center offset prediction for
    each cell. The blue mask corresponds to the object cells for which
    the objectness probability is no less than 0.5.

(b) The cells within solid red polygon compose a candidate object
    cluster.
The red filled five-pointed stars indicate the root nodes (cells) of
sub-graphs that correspond to the connected components. One candidate
object cluster can be composed of multiple neighboring connected
components whose root nodes are adjacent to each other.

The class probabilities are summed up over the nodes (cells) within the object cluster for each candidate obstacle type, including vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist and unknown. The obstacle type corresponding to the maximum averaged probability is the final classification result of the object cluster.

#### Post-processing

After clustering, Apollo obtains a set of candidate object clusters each
of which includes several cells. In the post-processing step, Apollo
first computes the detection confidence score and object height for each
candidate cluster by averaging the positiveness and object height values
of its involved cells respectively. Then, Apollo removes the points that
are too high with respect to the predicted object height and collects
the points of valid cells for each candidate cluster. Finally, Apollo
removes the candidate clusters that have either a very low confidence
score or small number of points, to output the final obstacle
clusters/segments.

The user-defined parameters can be set in the configuration file of
modules/perception/model/cnn\_segmentation/cnnseg.conf. The table below
explains the parameter usage and default values for CNN Segmentation.

| Parameter Name               | Usage                                    | Default    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |

| height_thresh                | If it is non-negative, the points that are higher than the predicted object height by height_thresh will be filtered out in the post-processing step. | 0.5 meters |
| min_pts_num                  | In the post-processing step, the candidate clusters with less than min_pts_num points are removed. | 3          |
| use_full_cloud               | If it is set by true, all the points of the original point cloud will be used for extracting channel features. Otherwise only the points of input point cloud (i.e., the points after HDMap ROI filter) are used. | true       |
| gpu_id                       | The ID of the GPU device used in the CNN-based obstacle prediction step. | 0          |

| feature_param {range}        | The range of the 2D grid with respect to the origin (the LiDAR sensor). | 60 meters  |

### MinBox Builder

The object builder component establishes a bounding box for the detected
obstacles. Due to occlusions or distance to the LiDAR sensor, the point
cloud forming an obstacle can be sparse and cover only a portion of
surfaces. Thus, the box builder works to recover the full bounding box
given the polygon point. The main purpose of the bounding box is to
estimate the heading of the obstacle (e.g., vehicle) even if the point
cloud is sparse. Equally, the bounding box is used to visualize the
obstacles.

The idea behind the algorithm is to find the all areas given an edge of
the polygon point. In the following example, if AB is the edge, Apollo
projects other polygon points onto AB and establishes the pair of
intersections that has the maximum distance. That’s one of the edges
belonging to the bounding box. Then it is straightforward to obtain the
other edge of the bounding box. By iterating all edges in the polygon,
in the following example as shown in figure 4, Apollo determines a
6-edge bounding box. Apollo then selects the solution that has the
minimum area as the final bounding box.

### HM Object Tracker

The HM object tracker is designed to track obstacles detected by the
segmentation step. In general, it forms and updates track lists by
associating current detections with existing track lists, deletes the
old track lists if it no longer persists, and spawns new track lists if new detections are identified. The motion state of the updated track
lists will be estimated after association. In HM object tracker, the
Hungarian algorithm is used for detection-to-track association, and a
Robust Kalman Filter is adopted for motion estimation.

#### Detection-to-Track Association

When associating detection to existing track lists, Apollo constructs a
bipartite graph and then uses the Hungarian algorithm to find the best
detection-to-track matching with minimum cost (distance).

**Computing Association Distance Matrix**

In the first step, an association distance matrix is established. The
distance between a given detection and one track is calculated according to
a series of association features including motion consistency,
appearance consistency, etc. Some features used in HM tracker’s distance
computing are shown as below:

| Association Feature Name | Description                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| location_distance        | Evaluating motion consistency     |
| direction_distance       | Evaluating motion consistency     |
| bbox_size_distance       | Evaluating appearance consistency |
| point_num_distance       | Evaluating appearance consistency |
| histogram_distance       | Evaluating appearance consistency |

Besides, there are some important parameters of distance weights which are
used for combining the above-mentioned association features into a final
distance measurement.

**Bipartite Graph Matching via Hungarian Algorithm**

Given the association distance matrix, as shown in figure 5, Apollo
constructs a bipartite graph and uses Hungarian algorithm to find the
best detection-to-track matching via minimizing the distance cost. It
solves the assignment problem within O(n\^3) time complexity. To boost
its computing performance, the Hungarian algorithm is implemented after
cutting original bipartite graph into subgraphs, by deleting vertices
with distance greater than a reasonable maximum distance threshold.

<div align=center><img src="images/3d_obstacle_perception/bipartite_graph_matching.png"></div>

<div align=center>Figure 5 Illustration of Bipartite Graph Matching</div>

#### Track Motion Estimation

After the detection-to-track association, HM object tracker uses a
Robust Kalman Filter to estimate the motion states of current track
lists with a constant velocity motion model. The motion states include
its belief anchor point and belief velocity, which correspond to the 3D
position and its 3D velocity respectively. To overcome possible
distraction caused from imperfect detections, Robust Statistics
techniques are implemented in the tracker’s filtering algorithm.

**Observation Redundancy**

The measurement of velocity, which is the input of filtering algorithm,
is selected among a series of redundant observations, including anchor
point shift, bounding box center shift, bounding box corner point shift,
etc. Redundant observations will bring extra robustness to filtering
measurement, as the probability that all observations fail is much less
than the one that a single observation fails.

**Breakdown**

Gaussian Filter algorithms always assume their noises are generated from
Gaussian distribution. However, this hypothesis may fail in motion
estimation problem, as the noise of its measurement may draw from
fat-tail distributions. To overcome the over-estimation of update gain,
a breakdown threshold is used in the process of filtering.

**Update according Association Quality**

The original Kalman Filter updates its states without distinguishing the
quality of its measurements. However, the quality of measurement is a
beneficial cue of filtering noise and somehow can be estimated. For
instance, the distance calculated in the association step could be a
reasonable estimate of quality of measurement. Updating the state of
filtering algorithm according to the association quality enhances
robustness and smoothness to the motion estimation problem.

A high-level workflow of HM object tracker is given in figure 6.

<div align=center><img src="images/3d_obstacle_perception/hm_object_tracker.png"></div>

<div align=center>Figure 6 Workflow of HM Object Tracker</div>

1)  Construct the tracked objects and transform them into world coordinates.

2)  Predict the states of existing track lists and match detections to
    them.

3)  Update the motion state of updated track lists and collect the
    tracking results.
### Sequential Type Fusion

To smooth the obstacle type over the whole trajectory and reduce the type switch between adjacent frames, Apollo utilizes a sequential type fusion algorithm based on a linear-chain Conditional Random Field (CRF), which can be formulated as below:

<div align=center>![CRF_eq1](images\3d_obstacle_perception\CRF_eq1.png)</div>

<div align=center>![CRF_eq2](images\3d_obstacle_perception\CRF_eq2.png)</div>

where the unary term acts on each single node, while the binary one acts on each edge. 

The probability in the unary term is the class probability output by the CNN-based prediction, and the state transition probability in the binary term is modeled by the obstacle type transition from time t-1 to time t, which is statistically learned from large amounts of obstacle trajectories. Specifically, Apollo also uses a learned confusion matrix indicating the probability of changing from the predicted type to ground truth type to rectify the original CNN-based class probability. 

The sequential obstacle type is finally optimized by using Viterbi algorithm to solve the following problem:

<div align=center>![CRF_eq3](images\3d_obstacle_perception\CRF_eq3.png)</div>

## RADAR Obstacle Perception

Given the radar data from the sensor, some basic process would be done. First of all, the track id needs to be extended, because Apollo needs a global track id for id association. Original radar sensor only provides id with 8 bits, so it is hard to determine if two objects with same id in two adjacent frames are denotes one object in tracking history, especially there exits frame dropping problem. Apollo uses meas state provided by radar sensor to handle this problem. Meanwhile, Apollo assigns new track id to the object which far away from the object with same track id in last frame. Secondly, false positive filter is used to remove noise. Apollo set some threshold via RADAR data to filter results that would be noise. And then, objects is built according the RADAR data as an unified object format. Apollo translates objects into world coordinate via calibration results. Original RADAR sensor provides the relative velocity of the object, so Apollo uses host car velocity from localization. Apollo adds these two velocity to denote the absolute velocity of the detected object. Finally, HDMap roi filter is used to get interested objects. Only objects inside the roi is used by sensor fusion algorithm.

## Obstacle Results Fusion

The sensor fusion module is designed to fuse LIDAR tracking results and RADAR detection results. In general, fusion items is kept, Apollo first matches the sensor results with the fusion items by tracking id, then computes association matrix for unmatched sensor results and unmatched fusion items to get an optimal matching result. For the matched sensor result, update the corresponding fusion item by Adaptive Kalman Filter. For the unmatched sensor result, create a new fusion item. For the unmatched fusion item, removed from the fusion items if it is too stale. 

### Fusion Items Management

Given the RADAR results, they would be pushed into a cache; given the LIDAR results, the fusion action would be triggered. Apollo has the concept of publish-sensor. The frequency of sensor fusion output is same as the frequency of publish sensor. Apollo's publish-sensor is LIDAR. The sensor results would feed the fusion pipeline sorted by sensor time stamp. Apollo keeps all sensor results. Survival time is set to different sensor  objects in Apollo. A object is keep alive if at least one sensor result should be surviving. Apollo perception module provides fusion results of LIDAR and RADAR in short range area around the car and radar only results in long distance.  

### Sensor Results to Fusion Lists Association

When associating sensor results to the fusion lists, Apollo first matches the identical track id  of the same sensor, then constructs a bipartite graph and uses Hungarian algorithm to find the best result-to-fusion matching of unmatched sensor results and fusion lists via minimizing the distance cost. The Hungarian algorithm used is the same as HM Object Tracker before. The distance cost is computed by the the euclidean distance of anchor points of the sensor result and fusion item.

### Motion Fusion

Apollo uses Adaptive Kalman filter to estimate the motion of current item with a constant acceleration motion model. The motion states include its belief anchor point, belief velocity and belief acceleration, which correspond to the 3D position, its 3D velocity and acceleration respectively. Actually, Apollo only gets position and velocity from sensor results. In motion fusion, Apollo caches state of all sensor result and computes acceleration via Kalman Filter.  Apollo provides uncertainty of position and velocity in LIDAR tracker and RADAR detector. Apollo feeds all the states and uncertainty to Adaptive Kalman Filter to get the fused results. What needs to be explained is, to overcome the over-estimation of update gain, a breakdown threshold is used in the process of filtering.
